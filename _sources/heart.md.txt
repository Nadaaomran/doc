# Heart Analytics

Advanced cardiovascular analysis from heart rate and ECG data, providing comprehensive insights into cardiac health and autonomic function.

## Overview

Heart analytics in Delve Analytics transforms raw heart rate and ECG data into clinically-relevant cardiovascular metrics that are essential for understanding cardiac health, autonomic nervous system function, and exercise physiology. Our methods are based on established cardiovascular research protocols and provide actionable insights for researchers and healthcare professionals.

## Core Methods

### 1. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

**What it measures:** Variability in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, reflecting autonomic nervous system function

**Biological significance:**
