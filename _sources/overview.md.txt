# Delve Analytics Documentation

Welcome to **Delve Analytics** - the comprehensive platform for wearable data analysis that transforms raw sensor data into meaningful health insights.

## What is Delve Analytics?

Delve Analytics is a cutting-edge web application designed to bridge the gap between complex wearable data and actionable health insights. Instead of spending months learning literature and implementing analytics methods from scratch, researchers and healthcare professionals can now access **ready-to-use, scientifically-validated analytics packages** that provide immediate, meaningful results.

### Why Delve Analytics?

Traditional wearable data analysis requires:
- üìö Extensive literature review to understand methods
- üî¨ Deep expertise in signal processing and biostatistics  
- ‚è∞ Months of development time for each analysis
- üß™ Validation and testing of custom implementations

**Delve Analytics eliminates these barriers** by providing:
- ‚úÖ **Pre-validated methods** based on peer-reviewed research
- ‚úÖ **Clear biological rationale** for each analysis
- ‚úÖ **Ready-to-use implementations** with minimal setup
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive documentation** explaining the science behind each method
