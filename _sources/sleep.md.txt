# Sleep Analytics

Comprehensive sleep analysis from wearable device data, providing insights into sleep quality, architecture, and circadian patterns.

## Overview

Sleep analytics in Delve Analytics transforms raw sleep data into clinically-relevant metrics that are essential for understanding sleep health, diagnosing sleep disorders, and monitoring treatment outcomes. Our methods provide actionable insights for researchers and healthcare professionals.

## Core Methods

### 1. Sleep Efficiency Analysis

**What it measures:** The percentage of time in bed spent actually sleeping

**Biological significance:**
- **Sleep efficiency** is a key indicator of sleep quality and restorative sleep
- **Low sleep efficiency** (<85%) is associated with daytime fatigue, cognitive impairment, and increased health risks
- **High sleep efficiency** (>90%) indicates good sleep consolidation and quality
- **Sleep fragmentation** reduces sleep efficiency and is linked to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders

**Technical implementation:**
- **Sleep efficiency calculation:** (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) Ã— 100
- **Time in bed computation:** Sleep Onset Latency + Total Sleep Time + Wake After Sleep Onset + Latency to Out of Bed
- **Multi-day aggregation** for longitudinal sleep pattern analysis

**Key metrics:**


### 2. Sleep Architecture Analysis

**What it measures:** Distribution and quality of different sleep stages (Deep, Light, REM, Wake)

**Biological significance:**


**Technical implementation:**


**Key metrics:**


### 3. Sleep Fragmentation Index

**What it measures:** The frequency of sleep stage transitions

**Biological significance:**


**Technical implementation:**


**Key metrics:**


### 4. Circadian Sleep Patterns

**What it measures:** Sleep timing variability and circadian rhythm analysis

**Biological significance:**


**Technical implementation:**


**Key metrics:**


### 5. Heart Rate During Sleep

**What it measures:** Cardiovascular activity patterns during different sleep stages

**Biological significance:**


**Technical implementation:**


**Key metrics:**
